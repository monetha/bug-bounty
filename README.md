# Monetha Bugs Bounty Program
[https://bounty.monetha.io](https://bounty.monetha.io)

The Monetha Bugs Bounty Program provides bounties for vulnerability bugs. Our development and security teams has made every effort to eliminate all bugs in our systems, however there's always the chance that we might have missed some potential vulnerabilities. If you discover it, we appreciate your cooperation with us. For vulnerability bugs, we offer rewards. Before you get started please see our Service Level Agreements & Eligibility sections for more details.

### Service Level Agreements
Monetha appreciates you taking the time to participate in our bug bounty program. We invest time and energy into our program to make it the best it can be. There are some things you can expect from us when participating in our program:

#### Monetha will make our best effort to:
* Provide an initial response on all reports within one business day.
* Let you know if your report will qualify for a bounty (or not) within five business days.
* If the report qualifies for a bounty, we will set a risk level of severity and the size of reward within five business days.
* Resolve qualifying vulnerabilities within 90 days (1 day for critical, 1-2 weeks for high, 4-8 weeks for medium and 90 days for low issues). More complex issues may require longer to fix. If you have a question on remediation timeline, please inquire directly on the relevant report.
* Notify you within five business days once an issue has been resolved.
* The value of rewards paid out will vary depending on Severity. The severity is calculated according to the OWASP risk rating model based on Impact and Likelihood:
* Bounty payment - up to 1 week from the time when report was approved and validated. Reward sizes are guided by the rules below and payable in ETH.
    - Critical: $5,000 - $10,000
    - High: $1,000 - $5,000
    - Medium: $500 - $1000
    - Low: $100 - $500
    - Note: up to $100
    
### Eligibility
The following requirements must be adhered to in order to participate in Monetha's bug bounty program, and for any report to qualify. Not following these requirements can result anywhere from your report being rejected, up to a ban from the program, depending on the severity.

* Report format - for any report to be considered, you must provide clear instructions on how to reproduce the issue, as well as how it could be exploited (attack scenario), and (to the best of your knowledge) what is the security impact. This information helps us assess eligibility and appropriate bounty amounts.
* First come, first served - only the first person to identify a particular vulnerability will qualify for a bounty. Any reports submitted after that will be considered as duplicates and will not qualify.
* Play it safe - all testing must be performed on test accounts under your control. Any attacks against other users without provable express consent is not allowed and may result in a ban from our program. If a particular issue is severe enough that a PoC in itself may expose other usersâ€™ data, please ask us for help first so we can work together on how to safely demonstrate the bug.
* Don't disclose early - to best protect our users, please keep all identified vulnerability details between you and us until we've had a chance to fix the issue. Public disclosure prior to us notifying you of the fix may result in a ban from the program. If you have questions on remediation timeline, please inquire directly on the relevant report.
* No social engineering - bugs that require social engineering to exploit (e.g. tricking someone into clicking a link) may qualify, but please do not actually attempt to social engineer another user, any Monetha team member, etc., during your testing. Providing a clear explanation of how social engineering could be used in conjunction with an identified vulnerability is sufficient.

### Scope
Any design or implementation issue that substantially affects the confidentiality or integrity of user data is likely to be in scope for the program.
